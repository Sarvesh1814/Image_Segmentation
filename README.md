# Image_Segmentation using Deep Learning

This repository contains projects related to image segmentation using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. The projects included in this repository are:

## Forest Area Segmentation
- File: Forest.ipynb
- Description: This project focuses on segmenting forest areas in images using deep learning techniques. The code is implemented in Python and utilizes popular libraries such as TensorFlow and OpenCV.

## Lung Segmentation
- File: Lung_Segmentation.ipynb
- Description: This project is aimed at segmenting lung regions in chest X-ray images using CNN architectures. The code is implemented in Python and utilizes libraries such as TensorFlow and OpenCV.

**Please note that the datasets required for these projects are not included in this repository. You need to obtain the datasets separately and place them in the appropriate directories. Make sure to follow the instructions provided within each project's notebook to properly set up the dataset and run the code**

Feel free to explore the projects, experiment with different CNN architectures, and adapt the code according to your needs. Happy coding!
